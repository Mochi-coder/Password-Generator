# Password-Generator

## Description

Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

You'll create an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code that you will write. Your app will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

<li> Length of password:
<li> At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
<li> Character types:
<li> Lowercase
<li> Uppercase
<li> Numeric
<li> Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

---------------------------------------
 This challenge was difficult and required help in how to ensure at least one character was included. After a lot of research and help from others, the password generator worked!
